# Notes: 4.1.24 Lesson
# good to learn linux, terminal in r studio is linux
# every column in a variable
# R likes to work on vectors, it is faster than loops
# you can create a sql db within r
# dplyr and tidyr package for data manipulation (gives speed)
# learn how to aggregate data and group it
# R likes to work at level of arrays, it is a vector language
# make sure you document everything
# know: ggplot2 ( for jobs), lattice (preferred to some industries), plotly
#(was built in python, it makes interactive plots), you can wrap plotly around
# ggplot2 to make the chart interactive
# Ctrl enter is the same as run
# remove(variable) to remove a variable
# numbers can hold . digits
# python is a 0 indexing language
# R is a 1 indexing language
# sometimes you have to call garbage
# you don't need to put return in R, it will return the last line of code

Lesson 4.3.24
The core principles of tidy data are:

    Each Variable Forms a Column: In tidy data, each variable
    (i.e., a characteristic or attribute being measured) is stored in its
    own column. This means that each column represents a single variable, and
    each value within that column corresponds to a specific observation.

    Each Observation Forms a Row: Tidy data organizes data such that each
    row represents a unique observation or case. This ensures that all
    information pertaining to a single observation is contained within that row.

    Each Type of Observational Unit Forms a Table: Tidy data is typically
    organized into separate tables (data frames in R) for each type of observational unit. For example, if a dataset contains information about both individuals and their corresponding measurements, there would be one table for individuals and another for measurements, with a common key linking the two tables.

    Each Value Should Be in One Cell: Tidy data ensures that each cell in the dataset contains a single value. This makes it easier to perform computations, filtering, and other operations on the data.
